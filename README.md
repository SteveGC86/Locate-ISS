# Locate-ISS
Learning how to use python and pandas to plot the location of the International Space Station.
I'm planning on plotting a single point of the ISS using the api http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/
and the pandas plotly. Once I have managed to plot a single point I would like to be able to record multiple locations
of the ISS over a certain time period (yet to be determined) and plot all locations to one map.

Bigger goals (if i can get one or two done in time) would be to plot and track the location of
  1. New segments being delivered to the ISS (Nauka if it gets there)
  2. CNSA's new space station
  3. Crews being flown to ISS
  4. Starlink (if I can find an api)
  Some of the locations can be found via this api(http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt)

Another goal is to turn this into a shell script to display within my terminal
